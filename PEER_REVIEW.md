### **Peer Review Report: iYak32 ESP32 Firmware**

First and foremost, this is a very impressive and capable project. It's a powerful, feature-rich firmware that demonstrates a strong understanding of embedded systems programming, with a flexible web interface, MQTT integration for IoT, and several complex application modes. The ambition and functionality packed into this ESP32 are fantastic.

This review is intended to provide a constructive, in-depth look at the project's architecture and code to help guide its future development, making it even more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

### **1. Architecture Review**

The overall architecture is functional and demonstrates a solid grasp of embedded concepts, but it is currently centered around a single, monolithic component that creates significant challenges for future development.

**The Good:**

*   **Non-Blocking Logic and State Machines:** The use of non-blocking state machines is the standout architectural strength of this project. The `Hockey` class and the main `loop()` are excellent examples of how to write responsive, concurrent code. This approach allows the firmware to handle multiple tasks—like game logic, web requests, and sensor reads—simultaneously without getting stuck in blocking `delay()` calls. This is the correct and professional way to build a complex, interactive embedded application.
*   **Well-Designed Modules:** Several components are well-designed and adhere to the single-responsibility principle. The `WifiManager` has a clear, focused purpose of handling the network connection, and the `BMX280` driver is a clean, effective abstraction over the underlying sensor library, isolating hardware-specifics from the main application logic.

**The Challenge: The `Esp32` "God Object"**

The most significant architectural weakness is the `Esp32` namespace, which has become a "God Object"—a single piece of code that knows too much and does too much. This is a common anti-pattern in software design that leads to tightly coupled, brittle code.

Currently, the `Esp32` module is responsible for:
*   **Configuration Management:** Loading and saving configuration for multiple features from different files (`esp32config.json`, `io_config.json`).
*   **Direct Hardware Abstraction:** Reading the internal CPU temperature, monitoring battery voltage, and managing GPIO pins.
*   **Core Application Lifecycle:** Containing the global `setup` and `loop` functions, which orchestrates the entire application.
*   **Business Logic:** Routing and processing incoming MQTT messages, which ties it directly to the application's specific behaviors.

This centralization makes the code difficult to understand, test, and maintain. A change to one feature (e.g., adding a new MQTT command) requires modifying a massive, critical file that is also responsible for I/O, WiFi, and system startup. This dramatically increases the risk of introducing unintended side effects and bugs.

### **2. Data Communication & Exchange**

The project's data communication formats and APIs are generally well-defined and follow modern practices. The primary issues lie not in the design of the interfaces, but in their backend implementation.

**Web Interface (HTTP/JSON):**

*   **Frontend Excellence:** The frontend-to-backend communication is excellent. The web pages, particularly the I/O Control page, use modern `fetch` calls with `async/await` to interact with a well-designed, RESTful-style API. The UI is data-driven, responsive, and provides good user feedback, demonstrating a strong grasp of modern web development principles.
*   **Backend Tight Coupling:** The weakness is that the backend implementation of this API, located in `www.h`, is completely dependent on the `Esp32` God Object. API handlers make direct calls to `Esp32` functions, which means the web API cannot be tested, reused, or developed in isolation. This tight coupling makes the system rigid.

**MQTT Communication:**

*   **Strength in Standardization:** The standardized JSON format for outgoing MQTT messages is a major highlight. The wrapper that automatically adds a timestamp, sender ID, and message type is a fantastic design choice. It makes the data stream robust, self-describing, and easy for other IoT services to consume and parse, which is crucial for interoperability.
*   **Weakness in Incoming Logic:** The handling for incoming messages is convoluted. The `Mqtt` module correctly receives the message but then immediately delegates all processing to the `Esp32` module. This creates a confusing, circular dependency where `Mqtt` depends on `Esp32`, and `Esp32` depends on `Mqtt`. The responsibility for parsing and acting on messages should belong to the module that defines the protocol.

**Configuration Data Sprawl:**

*   Configuration settings are currently fragmented across several files with different formats: `esp32config.json` (JSON), `io_config.json` (JSON), `config.txt` (custom key-value for WiFi), and `mqtt.txt` (custom key-value). This inconsistency makes configuration management more complex than it needs to be. Centralizing all settings into one or two main JSON files would be a much cleaner, more unified approach.

### **3. Feature & Code Quality Review**

The project includes a mix of very high-quality, production-ready features and some that need significant refinement to meet the same standard.

*   **High-Quality Features:**
    *   The **Hockey Scoreboard** mode is the star of the show. It is a complex, interactive feature implemented with a robust, non-blocking state machine. It handles game logic, timing, and user interaction flawlessly without compromising the responsiveness of the system. It is a perfect blueprint for how other complex features should be implemented.
    *   The **Generic I/O Configuration** system is another powerful core feature. The ability to define pin roles and behaviors in a JSON file allows for tremendous flexibility and project adaptation without needing to recompile code.
    *   The `BMX280` driver is a clean, well-written module that serves as a great example of a hardware abstraction layer.

*   **Features Needing Improvement:**
    *   The **Buzzer** module contains **blocking code**, which is a critical issue in an event-driven system. A blocking function is one that freezes the entire processor until it's finished. The `playSiren()` function uses multiple long `delay()` calls. While the siren is playing, the ESP32 is completely unresponsive—it cannot handle web requests, process MQTT messages, update sensors, or do anything else. This must be refactored to be non-blocking.

*   **General Code Quality & Practices:**
    *   **Implementation in Headers:** Many important class and function implementations are located in header (`.h`) files. While this is valid C++, it is not best practice. It can significantly increase compile times (as the code is re-compiled in every file that includes the header) and blurs the line between a module's public interface and its private implementation. Separating declarations (`.h`) from their definitions (`.cpp`) leads to better organization, faster builds, and clearer code.
    *   **Code Clutter:** The `platformio.ini` file and other parts of the code contain large blocks of commented-out code and unused library references. This "dead code" adds noise and can be confusing for new developers. It should be removed to improve readability.
    *   **Inconsistent Naming:** There are some inconsistencies in naming conventions (e.g., `Timerz` vs. `TimeAlarms`). Adopting a single, consistent style would improve readability.

### **4. Key Recommendations for Improvement**

Here is a prioritized, actionable list of recommendations to elevate the project to the next level of quality and professionalism.

1.  **Refactor the `Esp32` "God Object" (Highest Priority):**
    *   This is the most critical change. Break the `Esp32` namespace into smaller, single-responsibility modules. For example:
        *   A `ConfigManager` class to handle loading, saving, and accessing all JSON configuration data.
        *   An `IOManager` class to manage `io_config.json`, pin setup, and I/O control.
        *   A `HardwareManager` or `SystemMonitor` class for reading the CPU temperature, battery voltage, and other system-level metrics.
    *   This refactoring will make the codebase more modular, testable, and easier to reason about, which is essential for long-term maintenance.

2.  **Eliminate All Blocking Code (Critical for Responsiveness):**
    *   Rewrite the `Buzzer::playSiren()` function and any other sound effects that use `delay()` to be non-blocking. This will likely require expanding the buzzer's internal logic into a state machine that plays one note segment at a time, using `millis()` for timing, much like the Hockey mode's loop.

3.  **Decouple Message & Request Handling:**
    *   Move the logic for parsing and handling incoming MQTT messages *into* the `Mqtt` module, where it belongs. The `Mqtt` module can then use a callback/observer pattern or call functions on other modules (like a new `FeatureManager`) to trigger actions, inverting the current dependency.
    *   Decouple the web API handlers in `www.h` from the `Esp32` module. Handlers should call functions on the new, smaller modules (like `ConfigManager` or `IOManager`). This makes the API a true "front door" to the system's features, not a backdoor into a monolithic object.

4.  **Consolidate and Unify Configuration:**
    *   Migrate all settings from `config.txt` and `mqtt.txt` into the main `esp32config.json` file. This will create a single source of truth for all configuration and simplify the `ConfigManager`'s job.

5.  **General Code Hygiene and Best Practices:**
    *   Systematically separate class implementations from header (`.h`) files into corresponding source (`.cpp`) files.
    *   Perform a full cleanup pass: remove the large blocks of commented-out libraries from `platformio.ini` and any other dead or commented-out code from source files.
    *   Adopt a consistent code formatting tool (like the one built into VS Code/PlatformIO with `clang-format`) and apply it to the entire codebase to standardize style.

This project has a fantastic and highly capable foundation. By addressing these architectural and quality-of-life issues, particularly the `Esp32` God Object, you can significantly improve its long-term maintainability and scalability, transforming it from a great project into a truly top-tier, professional-grade firmware.

### **TODOs from Codebase**

This section lists technical debt and planned improvements noted directly in the source code.

*   **`src/main.cpp`**: The `BMX280.h` include should be encapsulated within a dedicated device manager instead of being in the main file.
*   **`src/main.cpp`**: The `Esp32::configPin` function should return the configured pin object to avoid redundant lookups.
*   **`src/main.cpp`**: The MQTT data sending frequency should be configurable via the web interface.
*   **`src/api/WifiManager.cpp`**: WiFi credentials in `config.txt` should be moved into `esp32config.json`.
*   **`src/api/Esp32.cpp`**: Add a validation check to ensure the `battery_monitor_pin` is a valid ADC pin.
*   **`src/api/archive/MQ2.h`**: The use of `delay()` in this module will conflict with the `TimeAlarm` class and should be refactored.
*   **`src/api/archive/Weather.h`**: The `pinMode` call for the DHT sensor may be redundant with the main device configuration.
*   **`src/api/archive/MQ2.cpp`**: The magic number `10` in the gas percentage calculation should be replaced with the `Ro` value.
*   **`src/api/archive/MQ2.cpp`**: A change from `log()` to `log10()` was made; verify this is correct and not needed elsewhere.
*   **`src/api/archive/Timerz.h`**: Is the 4-timer limit an ESP32 hardware limitation or a software one? Investigate if `MAX_TIMER` can be increased.
*   **`src/api/archive/Timerz.h`**: The timer setup should use the length of a name array for the `timer_id` instead of manual assignment.
*   **`src/api/archive/Timerz.h`**: The `handleInterrupt` function should be refactored to use actions in a child class to avoid a `switch()` statement.
*   **`src/api/archive/Timerz.h`**: The `timerAlarmWrite` for 24-hour alarms is commented out and needs to be implemented correctly.
*   **`src/api/archive/time/TimeLib.h`**: The `SECS_PER_YEAR` macro does not account for leap years.
*   **`src/api/WifiManager.h`**: Add the capability to configure a fixed IP address from EEPROM.
*   **`data/tides.html`**: Stock last tides data gathered so you can always display some infos on graph.
*   **`data/tides.html`**: The `apikeyTides` should be moved to a configuration file.
